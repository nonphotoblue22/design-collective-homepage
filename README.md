## Why we're hosting on github
Because we're cheap students, and we want to basically minimize the cost of running an organization. Github pages is an excellent way of doing this.

Furthermore, if people want to get involved and practice their html, css, or js skills, Github is a great platform to get introduced to front-end frameworks, working collaboratively with others, and learning a versioning tool like git.
