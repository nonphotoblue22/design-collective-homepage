# SMCDC - Santa Monica College Design Collective

## What is the SMCDC
The Santa Monica College Design Collective (SMCDC) is a student-run organization at Santa Monica College. We aim to build a thriving design community among the students interested in design at Santa Monica College. We create a space to share, learn, and practice design for all students interested in the field of design.

## Dependencies

### Front-end Libraries
[http://tachyons.io/](http://tachyons.io/) -
Tachyons is a css design system and framework made to create fast loading, highly readable, and 100% responsive interfaces with as little css as possible.


## Why we chose these dependencies
@todo

## Why we're hosting on github
Because we're cheap students, and we want to basically minimize the cost of running an organization. Github pages is an excellent way of doing this.

Furthermore, if people want to get involved and practice their html, css, or js skills, Github is a great platform to get introduced to front-end frameworks, working collaboratively with others, and learning a versioning tool like git.
